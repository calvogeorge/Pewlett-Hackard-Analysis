To help the company manage this retiring boom or silver tsunami as is being dubbed inside the company. The scope of this work is to provide data to help Pewlett-Hackard surf this silver tsunami.

## 2. Results

•	Reviewing the tables generated as part of deliverable 1, we cannot use the data to accurately see the current retirement situation at Pewlett-Hackard. If we look at table “retiring_titles” (Table 2.1), we see the employee count being 90,398, which would be over 37% of Pewlett-Hackard’s total workforce, a significant number, but since we do not know how many of these are actual current employees we don't know the true impact. To fix the results of for deliverable 1, we need to update our queries with a filter to only produce include current employees.

•	With a retirement being a high percentage of the company's total employees, it is imperative for the company to have all department manager plan to promote current employees to senior roles and leadership positions within the department, and hire new employees to fill their respective departments voids.

•	The mentorship_eligibility table shows the many senior engineers, senior staff and technique leader, the company should focus its efforts in recruiting these higher ranker members for the membership programs, since it most they have more relevant experience to help nurture the next generation of leader and senior members.
